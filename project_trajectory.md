# Project Trajectory

#### Goals: 
 - To be able to see at a glance the trajectory one or more open source projects are on
 - See how funding of work on a project impacts various metrics
 - potentially discovering correlation between metrics and other project activities

#### Sub-goals: 
- should be mostly independent of software ecosystem, language or runtime specifics
- should be trackable over time, ideally including access to historical data
- should be independent of project/community size
- should be aggregatable across many projects

#### Non-goals
  - measuring individual developer productivity
  - punishing projects that have less than ideal metrics

## Areas

### Contribution metrics

A project on an upwards trajectory should see an increase in number of contributions:

- increase in commits, issues, pull requests, reviews and comments
- increase in number of contributors
- increase in diversity of contributors 
- increase in new contributors

whilst also avoiding increased response times for contributions:

- decrease in time to first response to issues, pull requests, reviews
- decrease in time to resolve issues
- decrease in time to merge code contributions 
- decrease in time to review code contributions

### Maintainence Metrics

A project on an upwards trajectory should see regular activity from it's maintainers:

- increase in releases
- decrease in time between releases
- descrease in outdated dependencies
- descrease in number of unfixed security vulnerabilities
- descrease in time to response to security vulnerabilities

### Popularity Metrics

A project on an upwards trajectory should see an increase in popularity metrics:

- increase in stars, forks and watchers
- increase in downloads, page views and clones
- increase in dependent projects (if published as a library)
- increase in Q/A on stackoverflow

### Funding Metrics

A project on an upwards trajectory should see an increase in funding metrics:

- increase in income
- increase in expenses
- increase in funders
